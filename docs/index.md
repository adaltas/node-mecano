Mecano gather a set of functions usually used during system deployment. All the functions share a 
common API with flexible options.

`cp` `copy(options, callback)` Copy a file
------------------------------------------

`options`               Command options includes:   

*   `source`            The file or directory to copy.
*   `destination`       Where the file or directory is copied.
*   `force`             Copy the file even if one already exists.
*   `not_if_exists`     Equals destination if true.
*   `chmod`             Permissions of the file or the parent directory

`callback`              Received parameters are:   

*   `err`               Error object if any.   
*   `copied`            Number of files or parent directories copied.

todo:
*   deal with directories
*   preserve permissions if `chmod` is `true`
*   Compare files with checksum

`download(options, callback)` Download files using various protocols
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The excellent [open-uri](https://github.com/publicclass/open-uri) module provides support for HTTP(S), 
file and FTP. All the options supported by open-uri are passed to it.

Note, GIT is not yet supported but documented as a wished feature.

`options`               Command options includes:   

*   `source`            File, HTTP URL, FTP, GIT repository. File is the default protocol if source is provided without a scheme.   
*   `destination`       Path where the file is downloaded.   
*   `force`             Overwrite destination file if it exists.   

`callback`              Received parameters are:   

*   `err`               Error object if any.   
*   `downloaded`        Number of downloaded files

Basic example:
```coffeescript
mecano.download
    source: 'https://github.com/wdavidw/node-sigar/tarball/v0.0.1'
    destination: 'node-sigar.tgz'
, (err, downloaded) ->
    fs.exists 'node-sigar.tgz', (exists) ->
        assert.ok exists
```
`exec` `execute`([goptions], options, callback)` Run a command locally or with ssh
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command is send over ssh if the `host` is provided. Global options is
optional and is used in case where options is defined as an array of 
multiple commands. Note, `opts` inherites all the properties of `goptions`.

`goptions`              Global options includes:

*   `parallel`          Wether the command are run in sequential, parallel 
or limited concurrent mode. See the `node-each` documentation for more 
details. Default to sequential (false).
            
`options`               Include all conditions as well as:  

*   `cmd`               String, Object or array; Command to execute.

*   `host`              SSH host or IP address.   
*   `username`          SSH host or IP address.   
*   `stdout`            Writable EventEmitter in which command output will be piped.   
*   `stderr`            Writable EventEmitter in which command error will be piped.   

`callback`              Received parameters are:   

*   `err`               Error if any.   
*   `executed`          Number of executed commandes.   
*   `stdout`            Stdout value(s) unless `stdout` option is provided.   
*   `stderr`            Stderr value(s) unless `stderr` option is provided.   

`extract(options, callback)` Extract an archive
-----------------------------------------------

Multiple compression types are supported. Unless specified as 
an option, format is derived from the source extension. At the 
moment, supported extensions are '.tgz', '.tar.gz' and '.zip'.   

`options`               Command options includes:   

*   `source`            Archive to decompress.   
*   `destination`       Default to the source parent directory.   
*   `format`            One of 'tgz' or 'zip'.   
*   `creates`           Ensure the given file is created or an error is send in the callback.   
*   `not_if_exists`     Cancel extraction if file exists.   

`callback`              Received parameters are:   

*   `err`               Error object if any.   
*   `extracted`         Number of extracted archives.   

`git`

`options`               Command options includes:   

*   `source`            Git source repository address.

Simple usage:
```coffeescript

mecano.mkdir './some/dir', (err, created) ->
    console.log err?.message ? created
```
`rm` `remove(options, callback)` Recursively remove a file or directory

```coffeescript

mecano.rm './some/dir', (err, removed) ->
    console.log "#{removed} dir removed"

```Removing a directory unless a given file exists
```coffeescript
mecano.rm
    source: './some/dir'
    not_if_exists: './some/file'
, (err, removed) ->
    console.log "#{removed} dir removed"

```Removing multiple files and directories
```coffeescript
mecano.rm [
    { source: './some/dir', not_if_exists: './some/file' }
    './some/file'
], (err, removed) ->
    console.log "#{removed} dirs removed"
```
`render(options, callback)` Render a template file

*   `destination`       File path where to write content to.
*   `context`           Map of key values to inject into the template.

`callback`              Received parameters are:   

*   `err`               Error object if any.
