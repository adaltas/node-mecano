# Assertions

Assertions are a set of action properties available to every [handler](/current/action/handler) to guarantee its execution.

Assertions are executed after a handler and an error is thrown if the assertion doesn't validate. The name of the property is `assert` and `unassert` for its negation.

## Example

<!-- TODO: finish -->

## Assertion `assert`

<!-- TODO: finish -->

## Assertion `unassert`

<!-- TODO: finish -->
